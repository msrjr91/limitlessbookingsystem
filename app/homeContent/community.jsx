    title: 'WHY IS SOCIAL INTERACTION SO IMPORTANT?', 
    text: `Social interaction is the secret ingredient to a longer, happier life, backed by compelling research. Numerous studies, including a landmark meta-analysis published in the journal "PLOS Medicine," have consistently shown that strong social ties are associated with increased life expectancy. This research highlights the significant impact of social connections on our overall well-being and longevity. Engaging in meaningful social interactions stimulates our minds, boosts emotional resilience, and reduces stress. Moreover, sharing laughter, experiences, and support with friends and loved ones provides a sense of purpose and fulfillment that can't be achieved in isolation. At Limitless, we understand the vital role that community and social support play in the pursuit of a healthier, longer life. Join our vibrant community and experience firsthand the transformative power of social interaction on your journey to longevity.`

    title: 'MONTHLY CHALLENGES',
    text: `Our Monthly challenges are more than just fun and games; they are one of the ways we reward positive behavioural change. At Limitless, we recognize the profound impact that our monthly challenges can have on our memberâ€™s personal growth and well-being. These challenges offer a great way to encourage teamwork, self-improvement and pushing you to step out of your comfort zone, develop new habits, and break free from old unhealthy ones. Each month, you not only earn rewards but also build self-confidence, discipline, and resilience. Our challenges are not designed to reward the fastest or the strongest but to reward everyone who goes the extra mile and puts in the extra work outside of their session, to either improve themselves or help their team.`
